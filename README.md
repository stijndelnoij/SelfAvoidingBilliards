# SelfAvoidingBilliards

A very WIP repository of julia code for self avoiding billiards (SAB).
This code is pretty much a clone of DynamicalBilliards.jl, with some changes to accomodate self avoidance.
Notably, there is added functionality for reducing the billiard domain to its smallest necessary size.

To install simply run `Pkg.add("https://github.com/stijndelnoij/SelfAvoidingBilliards")` or `] add https://github.com/stijndelnoij/SelfAvoidingBilliards` in shell mode.

For more information about the code please view the [documentation](https://stijndelnoij.github.io/SelfAvoidingBilliards/)
