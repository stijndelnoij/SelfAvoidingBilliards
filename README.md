# SelfAvoidingBilliards

A very WIP repository of julia code for self avoiding billiards (SAB).
This code is pretty much a clone of DynamicalBilliards.jl, with some changes to accomodate self avoidance.
Notably, there is added functionality for reducing the billiard domain to its smallest necessary size.

# TODO
* make sure it actually works
* expand readme
* installation instructions
* example notebooks
